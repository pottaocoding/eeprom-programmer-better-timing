this is a fork of the eeprom programmer by ben eater that uses the nop instruction on the arduino nano to fix to too long delay on the write enable

this entends the chips lifetime because the normal delay is over the maximum
 i did not change anything other then to EEPROM_PROGRAMMER.INO so  the other sketches are not changed
